# TailwindCSS + React Learning Project üåê
This project is a full-stack website created to explore React and TailwindCSS on the frontend, with a simple Node.js backend API. The primary aim is to deepen knowledge of TailwindCSS and responsive design, heavily inspired by Net Ninja's TailwindCSS tutorial series.

## Getting Started
First, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 to see the frontend, and access the backend API endpoint at http://localhost:3000/api/home to confirm it‚Äôs running correctly.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js and styled with TailwindCSS, using components located in app/page.tsx.
- **Backend**: Node.js API sends a basic "Hello World" response for testing and setup.
## Features
- **React + TailwindCSS**: For a responsive and modern UI.
- **Node.js Backend**: Provides a minimal API to connect with the frontend.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to expand as your skills with Tailwind and React grow.
## Learning Goals
- Master TailwindCSS styling and responsive design.
- Integrate React and Node.js effectively in a full-stack app.
- Develop a structured, reusable project with room for further learning and development.
